          <p class="description">
            I am an aspiring engineer who enjoys connecting dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills
            and an academic background in electrical engineering, deep learning, and web design. I love doing the integration between hardware and software, that makes me love doing some of IoT projects.<br><br>

            I took undergraduate study in Petra Christian University especially in Electrical Engineering. I joined many organization to sharpen my softskill in communicating ideas with other people.
            I also have some side-jobs as web designer, photographer, and videographer that really sharpen my knowledge about handle many different kind of people.
            In my graduate, I made some website for PT Samudra Luas Makmur (an Aluminium Diecasting factory in Indonesia), I also became teaching assistant of web programming, android app development, and basics programming courses.<br><br>


            After graduated from Petra Christian University, I continue my study at National Chiao Tung University. I took Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as my major.
            In my graduate studies, I’ve taken on various project roles, including involved in Drone AR and Voice Recognition Control Interface project, I communicate and discuss with many library developer to provide information about bugs
            and many things to improve in the library.
            After involved in Voice Recognition team, now I already familiar with NLP and model conversion. I helped Barracuda Unity Developer for finding a new
            bug in Barracuda library where Barracuda couldn’t receive more than one batch of tensor by examining the tensor input using my vector from voice recognition of ONNX
            Model. I also helped ONNX Microsoft developer for enhance Sklearn2Onnx library and add new features for supporting Barracuda in Unity by giving recommendation what
            features to add, what ONNX Operators are still not supported in Barracuda, and my prototype of code.<br><br>

            My passion lies in solving business problems with do the integration between hardware and software fluently and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver
            high-performing AI solutions.
            I'm interested in IoT, app development, web design, data science, and machine learning. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at hutomoivan@gmail.com. <br><br>
